Phone Price Pridiction Explanation

If the resale value column is present → The ML model will train properly and learn the actual patterns between features (brand, RAM, storage, age, condition) and the resale price.

If the resale value column is missing → The model cannot be trained, and you’ll have to use a manual depreciation formula to estimate the price instead.



In Hindi

Agar resale value column nahi hai → model train nahi hoga, tumhe manually depreciation formula banana padega.
